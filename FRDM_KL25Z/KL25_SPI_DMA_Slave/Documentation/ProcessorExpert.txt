Module "SS_SPI1"   (component SPISlave_LDD)
   - SS_SPI1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc.   If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.    This method can be called only once. Before the second call of 
                Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - SS_SPI1_Enable -This method enables SPI device. This method is intended to be used together with <Disable()> method to 
                temporary switch On/Off the device after the device is initialized. This method is required if the <Enabled in 
                init. code> property is set to "no" value.
   - SS_SPI1_Disable -Disables the SPI device. When the device is disabled, some component methods should not be called. If so, 
                error ERR_DISABLED may be reported. This method is intended to be used together with <Enable()> method to 
                temporary switch on/off the device after the device is initialized. This method is not required. The <Deinit()> 
                method can be used to switch off and uninstall the device.
   - SS_SPI1_ReceiveBlock -This method specifies the number of data to receive. The method returns ERR_BUSY until the specified 
                number of characters is received. The method <CancelBlockReception> can be used to cancel a running receive 
                operation.
   - SS_SPI1_GetBlockReceivedStatus -This method returns whether the receiver is finished reception of all data block. The 
                status flag is accumulated, after calling this method the status is returned and cleared (set to "false" state).
                This method is available only if method ReceiveBlock is enabled.

Module "DMAT_S_SPI_TX" (component DMATransfer_LDD)
   - DMAT_S_SPI_TX_Init -Initializes the DMATransfer component. Allocates memory for the device data structure.  This method 
                can be called only once. Before the second call of Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - DMAT_S_SPI_TX_Deinit -Deinitializes the DMATransfer component.
   - DMAT_S_SPI_TX_AllocateChannel -The method allocates DMA channel for the DMA transfer. This method must be called before 
                DMA channel is initialized. Otherwise ERR_NOTAVAIL error code is returned after call of DMA_LDD channel methods.
   - DMAT_S_SPI_TX_EnableChannel -The method initializes and/or enables the DMA channel allocated for the DMA transfer defined 
                by the transfer descriptor input parameter DescriptorPtr. First call of this method on given DMA channel 
                initializes it and enables HW requests if Peripheral device or Always enabled trigger source is selected in 
                transfer descriptor Trigger source type item. This method can be also used together with Disable method to 
                temporary switch On/Off the DMA channel HW requests. In such case DMA channel registers are not reinitialized 
                again. New initialization of DMA channel can be done via SetChannelDescriptorUpdate method which reinitializes 
                whole channel with new transfer descriptor.
   - DMAT_S_SPI_TX_DisableChannel -The method disables the DMA channel allocated for the DMA transfer. However, it is still 
                possible to start transfer explicitly as SW transfer requests via StartChannelTransfer method.
   - DMAT_S_SPI_TX_SetSourceAddress -The method sets an data source address for to be transferred by the DMA channel allocated 
                for the DMA transfer. This method can be used to update DMA transfer source address when DMA channel is enabled.
                New source address is stored in transfer descriptor and written to associated DMA channel registers. The new 
                source address can be optionally checked for consistency with rest of the transfer descriptor data.
   - DMAT_S_SPI_TX_SetDestinationAddress -The method sets an data destination address for to be transferred by the DMA channel 
                allocated for the DMA transfer.  This method can be used to update DMA transfer destination address when DMA 
                channel is enabled. New destination address is stored in transfer descriptor and written to associated DMA 
                channel registers. The new source address can be optionally checked for consistency with rest of the transfer 
                descriptor data.
   - DMAT_S_SPI_TX_SetByteCount -The method sets a byte count (size of data) to be transferred for the DMA transfer. This 
                method can be used to update DMA transfer byte count when DMA channel is enabled. New transfer byte count is 
                stored in transfer descriptor and written to associated DMA channel registers. The new transfer byte count can 
                be optionally checked for consistency with rest of the transfer descriptor data. If nested operation is used, 
                the method sets the minor (inner) loop byte count.

Module "DMA_CTRL"  (component DMA_LDD)
   - DMA_CTRL_Init -Initializes the device according to design-time configuration properties. Allocates memory for the device 
                data structure.   If the <Enable in init. code> is set to "yes" then the device is also enabled (see the 
                description of the Enable method).  This method can be called only once. Before the second call of Init the 
                Deinit method must be called first.
   - DMA_CTRL_Deinit -Deinitializes the associated peripheral(s) and frees the component internal data structure.
   - DMA_CTRL_Enable -Enables DMA device.  This method is intended to be used together with Disable method to temporary switch 
                On/Off the device after the device is initialized.  This method is required if the <Enable in init. code> 
                property is set to "no" value.
   - DMA_CTRL_Disable -Disables the DMA device. When the device is disabled, some component methods should not be called. If so,
                error ERR_DISABLED is reported.  This method is intended to be used together with Enable method to temporary 
                switch On/Off the device after the device is initialized.  This method is not required. The Deinit method can 
                be used to switch off and uninstall the device.
   - DMA_CTRL_AllocateChannel -The method allocates DMA channel for the DMA transfer defined by the transfer descriptor input 
                parameter DescriptorPtr. This method must be called before DMA channel is initialized. Otherwise ERR_NOTAVAIL 
                error code is returned after call of DMA_LDD channel methods.
   - DMA_CTRL_EnableChannel -The method initializes and/or enables the DMA channel allocated for the DMA transfer defined by 
                the transfer descriptor input parameter DescriptorPtr. First call of this method on given DMA channel 
                initializes it and enables HW requests if Peripheral device or Always enabled trigger source is selected in 
                transfer descriptor Trigger source type item. This method can be also used together with Disable method to 
                temporary switch On/Off the DMA channel HW requests. In such case DMA channel registers are not reinitialized 
                again. New initialization of DMA channel can be done via SetChannelDescriptorUpdate method which reinitializes 
                whole channel with new transfer descriptor. After calling of EnableChannel method channel status is set to 
                LDD_DMA_IDLE.
   - DMA_CTRL_DisableChannel -The method disables the DMA channel allocated for the DMA transfer defined by the transfer 
                descriptor input parameter DescriptorPtr and disables HW requests services. However, it is still possible to 
                start transfer explicitly as SW transfer requests via StartChannelTransfer method. After calling of 
                DisableChannel method channel status is set to LDD_DMA_IDLE.

                allocated for the DMA transfer defined by the transfer descriptor parameter DescriptorPtr. This method can be 
                used to update DMA transfer source address when DMA channel is enabled. New source address is stored in 
                transfer descriptor and written to associated DMA channel registers. The new source address can be optionally 
                checked for consistency with rest of the transfer descriptor data.

                stored in transfer descriptor and written to associated DMA channel registers. The new destination address can 
                be optionally checked for consistency with rest of the transfer descriptor data.
   - DMA_CTRL_SetChannelByteCount -The method sets a byte count (size of data) to be transferred by the DMA channel allocated 
                for the DMA transfer defined by the transfer descriptor input parameter DescriptorPtr. This method can be used 
                to update DMA transfer byte count when DMA channel is enabled. New transfer byte count is stored in transfer 
                descriptor and written to associated DMA channel registers. The new transfer byte count can be optionally 
                checked for consistency with rest of the transfer descriptor data. If nested operation is used, the method sets

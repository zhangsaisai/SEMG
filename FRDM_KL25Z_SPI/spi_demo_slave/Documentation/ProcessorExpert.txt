Module "CsIO1"     (component KL25_ConsoleIO)

Module "SS1"       (component SPISlave_LDD)
   - SS1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc.   If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.    This method can be called only once. Before the second call of 
                Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - SS1_Deinit -This method deinitializes the device. It switches off the device, frees the device data structure memory, 
                interrupts vectors, etc.
   - SS1_SendBlock -This method sends a block of characters. The method returns ERR_BUSY when the previous block transmission 
                is not completed. The method <CancelBlockTransmission> can be used to cancel a transmit operation.
   - SS1_ReceiveBlock -This method specifies the number of data to receive. The method returns ERR_BUSY until the specified 
                number of characters is received. The method <CancelBlockReception> can be used to cancel a running receive 
                operation.
   - SS1_GetSentDataNum -Returns the number of sent characters. This method is available only if method SendBlock is enabled.
   - SS1_GetReceivedDataNum -Returns the number of received characters in the receive buffer. This method is available only if 
                the ReceiveBlock method is enabled.

Module "Cpu"       (component MKL25Z128LK4)
   - Cpu_SetOperationMode -This method requests to change the component's operation mode (RUN, WAIT, SLEEP, STOP). The target 
                operation mode will be entered immediately.   See <Operation mode settings> for further details of the 
                operation modes mapping to low power modes of the cpu.
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enables all maskable interrupts.
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disables all maskable interrupts.

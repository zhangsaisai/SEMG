Module "SysTick"   (component Init_SysTick_VAR0)
   - SysTick_Init -This method initializes registers of the SysTick module according to the Peripheral Initialization settings. 
                Call this method in user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE automatically; 
                see "Call Init method" property of the component for more details.

Module "SCL_G"     (component BitIO_LDD)
   - SCL_G_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.
   - SCL_G_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is read and returned (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - SCL_G_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is <b>input</b>, the component saves the value to a 
                memory or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                <tt>SetDir(TRUE)</tt>; see <a href="BitIOProperties.html#SafeMode">Safe mode</a> property for limitations). If 
                the direction is <b>output</b>, it writes the value to the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = 
                <u><tt>output</tt></u> or <u><tt>input/output</tt></u>).
   - SCL_G_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available 
                only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - SCL_G_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if the 
                direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

                property for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - SDA_G_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is <b>input</b>, the component saves the value to a 
                memory or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using

                interrupts vectors, etc.
   - SS_SPI0_SendBlock -This method sends a block of characters. The method returns ERR_BUSY when the previous block 
                transmission is not completed. The method <CancelBlockTransmission> can be used to cancel a transmit operation.
   - SS_SPI0_ReceiveBlock -This method specifies the number of data to receive. The method returns ERR_BUSY until the specified 
                number of characters is received. The method <CancelBlockReception> can be used to cancel a running receive 
                operation.

                property for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - Times_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is <b>input</b>, the component saves the value to a
